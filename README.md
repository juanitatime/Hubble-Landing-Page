## My process

  First I had to make sure that all the needed images and texts were already written on HTML. 
  I then started from top to bottom and organically added styling to which HTML element comes first. 
  I made sure the media query was on Mobile so the sizes would be exact. 
  From there I would check every now and then if the design I was creating was looking close to the given design. 
  Once the design for mobile was comeplete, I started editing the changes for the desktop view to make it look responsive for laptop users as well. When I undergo issues or when I can't seem to find a solution to a code, I would google the problem and reasearch, code, and test. Some of the links that helped me are found below. 
  
### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- FontAwesome Icons


### What I learned

- I learned how to create a mobile responsive design as well as a web responsive design using media queries. 
- I learned that in order for me to find out where the issues in code were, I had to play around with the browser's developer tools
- I also learned how to work using the delevoper tools inorder for the design to be responsive.
- I learned to always create a mobile responsive site before creating a web responsive one. 
- That patience in resolving issues in your code goes a long way.

### Continued development

I would really need to continue practicing in creating a mobile-first responsive website. Since I have been used to creating websites for desktop, I have to make sure it could be appealing when opening in mobile devices. 


### Useful resources

https://stackoverflow.com/questions/13550541/media-min-width-max-width - This taught me how to create media queries for responsive designs
https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/how-to-write-ahover-in-inline-css/ - I used this to learn how to do inline styling for the icons
