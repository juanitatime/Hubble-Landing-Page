## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the page depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page

### Screenshot

![](./screenshot.jpg)

Add a screenshot of your solution. The easiest way to do this is to use Firefox to view your project, right-click the page and select "Take a Screenshot". You can choose either a full-height screenshot or a cropped one based on how long the page is. If it's very long, it might be best to crop it.

Alternatively, you can use a tool like [FireShot](https://getfireshot.com/) to take the screenshot. FireShot has a free option, so you don't need to purchase it. 

Then crop/optimize/edit your image however you like, add it to your project, and update the file path in the image above.

**Note: Delete this note and the paragraphs above when you add your screenshot. If you prefer not to add a screenshot, feel free to remove this entire section.**

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- FontAwesome Icons

- [Styled Components](https://styled-components.com/) - For styles


### What I learned

I learned how to create a mobile responsive design as well as a web responsive design using media queries. 
I learned that in order for me to find out where the issues in code were, I had to play around with the browser's developer tools
I also learned how to work using the delevoper tools inorder for the design to be responsive.
I learned to always create a mobile responsive site before creating a web responsive one. 

### Continued development

I would really need to continue practicing in creating a mobile-first responsive website. Since I have been used to creating websites for desktop, I have to make sure it could be appealing when opening in mobile devices. 


### Useful resources

https://fontawesome.com/docs/web/style/size -  This website helped me in how to resize the icons from FontAwesome
https://stackoverflow.com/questions/13550541/media-min-width-max-width - This taught me how to create media queries for responsive designs
